This is the basic demo example I will modify as I work on future HDMI projects.
A demo video of it working is provided.

HDMI Project List:

1) Create a new test pattern to just write 1 unique color to the screen.

Simulation Flow:

I plan to start with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave to simulate the example HDMI project.
Although, some changes need to be made to the top level module in order to do that.
According to the TMDS_rPLL.ipc "Inter-Package Connection" file the output clock frequency
 for the TMDS Phase Lock Loop is 371MHz
